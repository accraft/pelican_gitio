Now that I've been in the house for over a year, I have a better idea of what types of grasses and weeds are growing in the lawn. There is a surprising amount of diversity, so I am using this post to go through the 4 most common grass types in the yard along with a few pictures to show the identification methodology. In the process of identifying the various grass species, I found the following sites most helpful:

* [Ohio State University Turfgrass Identification Key](https://buckeyeturf.osu.edu/pdf/01_turfgrass_identification.pdf)
* [Penn State Cool Season Turfgrass Identification Page](https://extension.psu.edu/the-cool-season-turfgrasses-identification)
* [Oregon State Grass Structures](https://forages.oregonstate.edu/regrowth/how-does-grass-grow/grass-structures)

Most nomenclature used in the identification and classification of turfgrasses is relatively intuitive, but there are a few specialized terms for the areas around where the blade extends from the main stalk. I therefore included an image from Oregon State guide below as a reference.

###Methodology
I have identified 6 main areas in the lawn, each with varying amounts of sunlight, water, and soil type. The are as follows:

1. Left: this area is partially shaded due to a cucumber tree and the side of the house. At first glance, this area seems to have the most robust grass growth. 
2. Front: This are is 100% full sun. It tends to get a bit brown in the summer, not surprising given the predominance of cold weather grass species
3. Right: Partially shaded, this area tends to form a bit of a path since it has the most foot traffic of all the lawn areas. There is only a narrow strip going to the backyard, and the compacted area tends to not have as much growth. I have an ongoing aeration experiment to see if drilling holes in the turf will make a meaningful impact in long term grass coverage. 
4. Back Right: this area is shaded in the morning but in the full light of day in the hot afternoon. This may be the most difficult area to maintain a solid turf coverage due to the combination of lack of light during the cooler morning and full sun during the most intense parts of the summer. 
5. Back Left: I have paid the most attention to this area since when we first moved in the ground was torn up after removing a tree. I attempted to plant several grass seed varieties, and while the lawn is definitely thicker than it was the first year, I am most interested in getting this area looking good in the next year. It is partially shaded with afternoon sun, and gets plenty of water. It is the most sloped of any parts of the yard, so I am curious to see how that impacts any turn development. Below is a picture showing my first (and very unsuccessful) turf grass growing trial.

###Tall Fescue
Per the [University of Maryland General Guidelines for Lawn Maintenance in Maryland](http://www.mdturfcouncil.org/resources/Documents/TT%20Bulletins/TT-63%20General%20Guidelines%20For%20Lawn%20Maintenance%20In%20Maryland.pdf) tall fescue blends are the best variety for the transition zone microclimate in the DC/MD/Northern VA region due to their lower fertilizer, water, and other maintenance requirements. Luckily it already appears this variety is the most widespread in the lawn, with a significant presence in all 5 regions of the yard, though probably weakest in the Back Right region.  

###Kentucky Bluegrass

###Fine Fescue

###Perenial Rye

###Broadleaf Plants and Other Weeds
